You are an expert React/Tailwind frontend architect.
I’ve uploaded my Builder AI–generated website code for CareerMap.com.
It currently has hundreds of files, folders, and subfolders that make it hard to maintain or connect with the backend.

Your task is to merge, simplify, and refactor the project into a smaller and cleaner file structure without changing a single function or breaking any existing functionality.

🎯 Primary Goal

Make the frontend lightweight and easy to manage while keeping every visual and functional behavior exactly the same.
After merging, all components, transitions, routes, and user interactions must work perfectly and smoothly as before.

⚙️ Rules for Refactoring
1. Code Consolidation

Merge related component files into one file per section/page.

Suggested structure:

/src
 ├── App.js
 ├── Layout.js
 ├── HomePage.js
 ├── CareerPage.js
 ├── BusinessPage.js
 ├── VacancyPage.js
 ├── DocsPage.js
 ├── InteractiveMap.js
 ├── utils.js
 ├── index.css
 └── index.js


Combine all small reusable components (buttons, inputs, cards, modals) into the file where they are most used.

Example: move CareerCard, GoalSelector, InterestFilter → inside CareerPage.js.

Keep Navbar and Footer in a single shared file called Layout.js.

2. Preserve Every Function

Before merging or removing any import:

Trace all function calls and make sure they still execute after merging.

Double-check key features:

By Goal, By Interest, Vacancy navigation

Interactive career map

Smooth scrolling & animations

Mobile responsiveness

Language, Account, Favorites, Save Progress buttons

Sort filters in By Interest

“Apply Now” links and redirect

Popup modals and their close buttons

Light and dark mode toggling

Do not delete or rename any functions or variables that are called globally.

If any function names conflict after merging, rename them using this pattern:
<OldFileName>_<FunctionName>() to avoid overwriting.

3. Performance Optimization

After merging:

Optimize imports (remove duplicates, unused packages, and redundant CSS files).

Add lazy loading for heavy sections (Interactive Map, Business Ideas, Vacancy List).

Ensure smooth scrolling transitions (use scroll-behavior: smooth).

Check that pressing Back or clicking Logo does not reload the page.

4. Styling and CSS

Merge all CSS or Tailwind styles into one stylesheet (index.css).

Keep Tailwind classes inline where possible.

Make Light Mode default, but preserve Dark Mode toggle if it exists.

Ensure text visibility in both themes.

5. Routing

Keep all route definitions (react-router-dom or equivalent) inside App.js.

Make sure internal navigation between:

Home

Jobs

Business

Documentation

Premium Notes
continues working exactly as before.

6. Data and State Management

Keep all state variables (career data, vacancies, user preferences) functional.

If using Context API or Redux:

Do not break the provider/consumer logic when moving components.

Ensure localStorage or sessionStorage used for saved user progress continues working.

7. Testing and Verification

After merging:

Run the project locally using npm start.

Verify that:

Every button, dropdown, link, and animation works.

Career Map loads correctly (no blank screens).

Page loads are fast and scroll smooth.

Mobile view works properly.

Ensure build passes successfully with npm run build.

8. Output Requirements

After successful merging:

Provide me with:

A new file structure tree of the simplified project.

A brief summary of all changes made.

The complete updated merged code (ready for backend integration).

9. Do Not Break or Remove

Existing animations or transitions from Builder AI.

Any meta tags or schema data related to SEO.

The site’s responsiveness or layout symmetry.

🧠 Context

Tech stack: React + Tailwind (Builder AI base).

Hosting: GitHub Pages / Vercel.

Objective: Keep same UI/UX, just reduce file count and make it backend-ready.

🚀 Final Expected Result

A fully working, smooth, responsive, light-mode–default version of my site with fewer source files, same look and behavior, and no broken logic.
After merging, I should be able to easily connect backend APIs and deploy the project without the blank white screen problem.

🧩 Example Completion

Replit should:

Show me the new file directory structure.

Ensure the merged project runs perfectly (npm run build succeeds).

Provide complete updated code files.

Confirm that all merged files compile and load in the same way as the original site.

End of Prompt.

✅ Pro Tip:
After you paste this prompt:

Wait for Replit AI to finish merging & optimizing.

Then type:

“Show me the new project file tree and highlight which files/functions were merged.”

That helps you confirm nothing got lost or renamed incorrectly.
